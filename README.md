### Hi there 👋

My name is Gabriel Rodriguez Aguilera. I'm currently studying an engineering degree in renewable energy sources. I'm currently learning programming to solve environmental problems. I'd like to master this subject due to the fact that in our current world everything needs programming to function.

I like to do sports and do excercise, I like to draw architecture, comic books, and I love music. 😝

I have 4 cats; Sylvester, Berlin, Jimbo and Yumi. 😺😸😹😻

I live in La Paz, Baja California Sur. I think this is one of the best cities I've ever lived in. There's beautiful beaches, streets, the people are nice and the weather is amazing 👌👣☂
